# 🏠 My Local Network – Home Topology Lab

## Overview
This lab explores the structure of a personal home network by identifying all connected devices, determining how each device connects to the network, and creating a complete network topology diagram.  
The purpose is to understand real-world networking concepts such as end devices, intermediary devices, wireless vs. wired connectivity, and network media.

## Objectives
- Record all end devices and network infrastructure devices on the local network.  
- Identify the connection type (wired/wireless) and media used by each device.  
- Create a network topology diagram showing all devices and their locations.  
- Label each device according to its role in the network.
