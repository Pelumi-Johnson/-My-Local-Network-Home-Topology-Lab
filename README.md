## 📘 Overview
This project analyzes the structure of a personal home network by identifying all connected devices, determining their connection types, and mapping how they communicate within the network.  
The purpose of this lab is to understand real-world networking concepts such as end devices, intermediary devices, wireless vs. wired media, and home network structure.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify all wireless end devices in the home.  
- Understand how the wireless router distributes connectivity to different rooms.  
- Build a clean home network topology diagram.  
- Document the role of each device within the home environment.

---

## 📡 Connectivity Summary
- **All devices in the home connect wirelessly (WiFi)**  
  Phones, tablets, laptops, smart TV, speakers, game consoles, and watches all use wireless access.
  
- **One wired connection exists:**  
  The **router is connected to the ISP modem via an Ethernet cable**, providing internet access to the entire home.

This represents a modern WiFi-first household setup.
